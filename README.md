This project focuses on the construction and analysis of an investment portfolio comprising four major stocks—Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon—along with the S&P 500 stock index, all traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). 
The primary goal of this study is to optimize the portfolio by applying advanced portfolio management techniques to minimize risk while potentially maximizing returns.
